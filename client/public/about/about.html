            <p>
                There are over <span>two-thirds</span> of students who graduated in 2015 who still hadn’t repaid their
                debt by 2018.
                Moreover, in 2015 there were over <span>1.7 million</span> students in Canada who had to take out a
                loan.
                With such concerning numbers, our team wanted to create an application that can allow students to budget
                effectively in hopes of reducing their debt.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app was developed as a project for <span>StemWarrior Hacks</span> in January 2022
                by Nivetha, Iqra and Tanveer.
                We wanted to create an application with everyday usage, and building an expense tracking website was
                easily one of our choices. As students we need to manage our expenses carefully and this app does just
                that by letting us calculate our expenses and browse previous transactions. It also provides advice to
                university students on budgeting, which can be viewed in the Advice option in the navigation bar. We
                hope that a lot of people benefit from our application that we designed to be user-friendly.
